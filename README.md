js-mmorpg
=========

A small project with Pixi.js and Node.js, it will be a basic mmorpg in HTML5 and Javascript    
Sorry for my poor english :p

For the assets of the game, I use [Shoebox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/ "Shoebox"), it's a free and very powerfull tool.    
It allow you to create SpriteSheets, Slice9, Bitmap fonts and other things. You should try it !
